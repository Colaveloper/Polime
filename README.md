# Polime

A daily challenger to boost my time management

APP PURPOSE

Polime is intended to remind me what to do, but
that's different from a list of to-dos, as it has a
human based model. It will show me if I am not
caring enough about school, sport, and much else,
by a daily self-evaluation of commitment in 5 human
facets. None of them should ever be ignored, so Polime
can notify myself when I do.

APP STUCTURE

Data and challenge will follow the same 5 aspects,
each one with its own challenges and self-evaluated
day to day, on a 1-20 scale. If something prevents
from caring about them, there's no penality: these
score are meant to show commitment to those aspects
whithin restraints of the case

aspect ------ application ------------------------------------ challenge

Physical ---- Sport, Eating Attitude ------------------------- Workouts, Diets, 8h Sleep

Creative ---- Art, New Thoughts Attitudes or Experiencies ---- Creating Portfolios or any Creative Project

Learning ---- School, Development, Adobe, Languages ---------- HW Anticipation, Grade Aim, Daily Anky

Social ------ Friends, Social Accounts, Dating --------------- New friends, Page Caring

Self Care --- Feeling good, Music Self Confidence ------------ Enhancement, Less Timewaste

Points for each aspect can be assigned every evening,
trying to reach a sum as close as possible to 100

Points Should represent both the detication to that
specific aspect and both the challenge attention.
The probable division will be 10-10

Challenges last for 5 weeks (too much?) and a new one
starts each sunday. eg the first could be about Social,
a week later starts Self Care and so on
