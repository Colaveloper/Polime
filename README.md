## Concept

Persistence doesn't come from hype, but from being sure that you're doing what needs to be done: this is the reason why Polime doesn't tell you what's good for you. It pushes you think about that. 

Is what you've done today good for your physical and mental health, for your social life, your skills and you creative production?  
What can you do to be satisfied at the end of the day? 

It's as simple as that.  
The active process happens inside your head, and Polime has the only purpose of storing your daily satisfaction levels, in order to suggest what you should care about later.

## How it works

5 aspects of life are considered (each one with its own slider):

The sliders are used to declare your satisfaction.  
Satisfaction = what you've done / what you intend to do  
The last two parameters are completely subjective, but not arbitrary. Having to think about them is the active process that most time-management app do instead of you. 

Many other time management app can be excessively specific (e.g. they tell you: play the piano!). I chose to keep Polime as simple and generic as possible not to waste your precius time, sheduling your day on a to-do app. It's way more efficient and raises awareness, making the active processes happen in your mind.
